HISTORY
I started Advanced Chain Technologies (ACTA) Pty. Ltd in July 1997 after a lifelong career in the Longwall Mining Industry. My career commenced as a mechanical apprentice in 1963 in the UK and progressed through to senior colliery management level by 1973. At the age of 29 I changed sides and started working for Original Longwall equipment suppliers in Development, Testing, Design, Installation and Sales worldwide. It has been my pleasure and to my benefit that I have worked with some of the most intellectual, experienced and enthusiastic Engineers associated with the evolution of Longwall coal mining as we know it today. The experience gained is manifested primarily into loyalty and support of the Longwall Engineer as without sustainable production, we have reduced energy, reduced employment and reduced returns to all shareholders who invest in our Industry.</p>
